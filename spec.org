* Systems of Pacman
** Sound system
*** Sounds are organized in layers
*** Some sounds can block (mute) all other sounds in layer
*** Each sound has a priority which determines what it can block
** Animation system
*** Sprites are loaded from an atlas texture ("spritesheet.png")
*** Each frame of an animation is a section of the texture
*** Animations are arrays of frames
** Game rendering system
*** The prerendered level background is drawn first
*** Points and energizers are drawn on top
*** Characters after that
*** UI at the very top and bottom
** UI System
*** Game state variable are displayed
**** Level number
**** Lives
**** Score
**** Fruits
** Update System
*** Only run game logic if game is ongoing
*** Handle sound system
*** Play spawn/death animations if applicable
*** Update and check the timers
*** Check collisions
*** Control Ghosts
*** Control Player
* Life cucle of Pacman
** Load game assets, set global state
** Convert hardcoded values into useful forms
** Load the first level
*** Load in level file
*** Set state variables
*** Create objects
*** Convert map to useful forms
**** Prerendered background
**** Pathfinding graph
** Update with game logic
** End game on static screens
*** Game Over
*** You Win
* Global State of Pacman
** Shared state for game logic
*** Current level
*** Amount of lives
*** Score
*** Points where next life is awarded
*** Upcoming fruit
** Assets
*** Sounds
*** Images
*** Animations/Sprites
** Level data
*** Character positions
*** Level topology
*** Wall color
*** Point positions
*** Energizer positions
*** Points to spawn fruit at
*** Position of ghost wall
*** Ghost speeds
*** Speed of player
*** Duration of scatter ghost ai phase
*** Duration of chase ghost ai phase
*** Amount of times ghosts scatter
** Level instance specific data
*** Running or chase mode for ghost ai
*** Timers for running or chasing
*** Timers for energizer powerup
*** Timers for spawn or death animations
*** Amount of dots on the level
*** Amount of dots eaten by the player
*** Amount of ghosts eaten by the player
*** Amount of times the ghosts have scattered
** Configured values (constant)
*** Width and height of each level
*** Width and height of each game tile
*** Amount of time that energizers last
*** Amount of points between lives
*** Speed of dead ghosts (confusing terminology)
*** Amount of points that fruit give
*** Amount of points that killing ghosts gives
* Ghost AI
** Pathfinding algorithm plots paths for ghosts to move along
** Operates on graph generated from level topology
** Each ghost has a unique AI
** Ghosts switch movement patterns based on game logic state
* File layout
** main.lua is the game's central loops and initializations
** conf.lua is game configuration file
** drawing.lua is the game rendering logic
** sound.lua is the game audio logic
** player.lua is the player controls logic
** ghost.lua is the ghost AI logic
** 1-3.lua are the level data files
** spritesheet.png is the game's atlas texture
** sounds contains the sounds used in the game
